# List of beginning projects for learning Python
## Mad Libs Generator
The input could be anything, an adjective, a noun, a pronoun, etc. 
Once all the inputs are entered, the application will take the data and arrange the inputs 
into a story template form. Sound fun, right?

## Number Guessing
Make a program in which the computer randomly chooses a number between 1 to 10, 1 to 100, or any range. 
Then give users a hint to guess the number. Every time the user guesses wrong, 
he gets another clue, and his score gets reduced. The clue can be multiples, divisible, 
greater or smaller, or a combination of all.

You will also need functions to compare the inputted number with the guessed number, to compute the 
difference between the two, and to check whether an actual number was inputted or not in this project.

## Text-based Adventure Game
This is a basic version of the Adventure game. It is completely text-based. In this version of the game, 
users can move about through different rooms within a single setting, and based on the user input, it will 
provide descriptions for each room.

Movement direction is crucial here – you must create walls and set the directions in which the users can 
move through the rooms, set movement restrictions, and also include a tracker that can track how far a user 
has walked or moved in the game.

## Dice Rolling Simulator
As the name of the program suggests, we will be imitating a rolling dice. This is one of the interesting projects and
will generate a random number each dice the program runs, and the users can 
use the dice repeatedly for as long as he wants. When the user rolls the dice, the program will generate a random 
number between 1 and 6 (as on a standard dice). 

The number will then be displayed to the user. It will also ask users if they would like to roll the dice again. 
The program should also include a function that can randomly grab a number within 1 to 6 and print it. 

## Hangman - sqlite example
This is more of a “guess the word” game. The core concepts you have to use while developing this project are variables, 
random, integer, strings, char, input and output, and boolean. 
In the game, users have to enter letter guesses, and each user will have a limited number of guesses 
(a counter variable is needed for limiting the guesses).

You can create a pre-organized list of words that users can grab words from. Also, you must include specific 
functions to check whether or not a user has entered 
a single letter or if the input letter is in the hidden word, to if the user has actually inputted a single letter, 
and to print the correct outcomes (letters).

## Contact Book
Everyone uses a contact book to save contact details, including name, address, phone number, and even email address. 
This is a command-line project where you will design a contact book application that users can use to save and find contact details. The application 
should also allow users to update contact information, delete contacts, and list saved contacts. The SQLite database 
is the ideal platform for saving contacts. 


## Email Slicer
The program helps get you the username and domain name from an email address. You can even customize 
the application and send a message to the host with this information.

## Binary search algorithm
Have you ever heard the proverb, “finding a needle in a haystack.” This program is designed to do just that- by using a 
binary search algorithm. You can create a list of random numbers between 0 to 100, with every succeeding number having 
a difference of 2 between them.

When the user inputs a random number, the program will check if that number is included in the list. It will do so by 
creating two halves of the list. If the program finds the number in the first half of the list, it will eliminate the 
other half and vice versa. The search will continue until the program finds the number input of the user or until the 
subarray size becomes 0 (this means that the number is not in the list). This python project idea will help you create 
an implement an algorithm that searches for an element in a list. 

## Desktop Notifier App
Have you ever wondered how notifications work? This small project idea will throw some light on this. The desktop notifier 
apps run on your system and send you a piece of information after a fixed interval of time. We suggest you use libraries 
such as notify2, requests, etc. to build such a program.

## Python Story Generator
This is a fun but exciting python project which will work wonders with kids. In a nutshell, the program will ask users 
for inputs such as the name of a place, action, etc. and then build a story around the data. The story will be the same 
always but with little variation with the input.

## YouTube video downloader
One of the best ideas to start experimenting with you hands-on python projects for students is working on a YouTube 
video downloader. More than a billion people watch YouTube every month. Sometimes there are videos we like to download 
permanently. YouTube doesn’t give you that option, but you can create an app with a simple UI and the ability to download 
YouTube videos in different formats and video quality. This project looks tough, but it is straightforward when you start 
working on it.

## Python Website Blocker
When we surf the internet, many unwanted websites keep showing up. This is one of the useful python projects where you 
can build a program that blocks certain websites from opening. This program is beneficial for students who want to study 
without any social media distractions.

## Spin a Yarn
The program first prompts the user to enter a series of inputs. These can be an adjective, a preposition, a proper noun, 
etc. Once all the inputs are in place, they are placed in a premade story template using concatenation. In the end, the 
full story is printed out to read some misintended madness!


## Find out, Fibonacci!
You input a number and the function created checks whether the number belongs to the Fibonacci sequence or not. The 
underlying workings are similar to the above ‘Leap it!’ program.
